# Setting Up Google Play Organization Account

## Why You Need This

Google Play requires **organization accounts** for apps that:
- Offer financial services (money transfers, payments, banking)
- Handle sensitive financial data
- Facilitate money transactions

Since CashLink declares "Money transfer and wire services", you need an organization account.

## Alternative: If You Don't Have a Business

If CashLink is **not** a registered business, you have two options:

### Option A: Register Your Business

1. Register as a business entity in your country
2. Get business registration documents
3. Follow the steps above to upgrade your account

### Option B: Adjust Your App Declarations

If you're **not actually providing financial services** (just facilitating connections), you can:

1. **Remove financial features declaration**:
   - Go to: **Policy** → **App content** → **Financial features**
   - Change: **"Money transfer and wire services"** → **"My app doesn't provide any financial features"**
   - **Note**: Only do this if you're truly just a marketplace/listing platform

2. **Update app description**:
   - Remove references to "money transfers"
   - Focus on: "Find money transfer agents" (not "transfer money")
   - Emphasize: "Community platform" and "Business directory"

3. **Re-submit for review**

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Don't misrepresent your app!**
